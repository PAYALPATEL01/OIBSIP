            Features like air bags, seat belts, crumple zones, and a bevy of
            automated safety technologies have dramatically improved passenger
            safety features that may be absent from a classic car, depending on
            how old it is.

            Modern cars are often described as “computers on wheels.” They come
            with automated driver assistance systems, large display screens,
            Internet connections and a multitude of ways to sync with
            smartphones. Yet in the rush to innovate and one-up competitors with
            ever newer technology, things may have gone too far.
